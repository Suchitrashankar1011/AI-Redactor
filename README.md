## ⚙️ Configuration

### Detection Sensitivity
The application includes advanced filtering to minimize false positives:

- **Context Analysis**: Analyzes surrounding text to determine if detected items are actually sensitive
- **Medical Context**: Special handling for medical documents to avoid redacting medical terms
- **Organizational Context**: Filters out military units, government departments, etc.
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Configurable confidence levels for different detection methods

### File Size Limits
Default limit is 16MB, configurable in `app_light.py`:
```python
app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH'] = 16 * 1024 * 1024  # 16MB
```
